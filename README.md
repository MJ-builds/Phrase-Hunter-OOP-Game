# Phrase-Hunter-OOP-Game
 Techdegree project 4

Welcome to Phrase Hunter 'guessing' game! 

This game randomly selects a phrase from the predefined list, and you as the player need to 'guess' the right letters that make up the full phrase.

The rules of the game are simple:

*   you have 5 lives
*   if you guess all letters correctly while still having lives available, you win!
*   if you run out of all 5 lives before guessing all the correct letters, you lose!

Right or wrong, a letter can only be selected once, after which point it is disabled for the rest of the round.

Changes:

Some aesthetic improvements have been made:

*   css: body background-image: url("../images/earth.jpg");
*   css: .start class background-image: url("../images/sky.jpg");
*   css: .win class background-image: url("../images/launch.jpg");
*   css: .lose class background-image: url("../images/moon.jpg");
*   css: added title_win and title_loss classes (on conditions of win or lose), for font color changes.

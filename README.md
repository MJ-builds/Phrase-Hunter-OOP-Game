Welcome to Phrase Hunter 'guessing' game! 

This game randomly selects a phrase from the predefined list, and you as the player need to 'guess' the right letters that make up the full phrase.

The rules of the game are simple:

*   you have 5 lives
*   if you guess all letters correctly while still having lives available, you win!
*   if you run out of all 5 lives before guessing all the correct letters, you lose!

Right or wrong, a letter can only be selected once, after which point it is disabled for the rest of the round.

Important:

Some aesthetic improvements have been made.
